# Healthcare Database Project

## Overview

This project involves the analysis and exploration of a healthcare dataset to derive insights and provide recommendations based on medical conditions. The dataset contains information about patients, medical conditions, treatments, and more.

## Files

- `Healthcare Database.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis and recommendations.
- `healthcare_dataset.csv.zip`: Compressed CSV file containing the healthcare dataset.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, numerize)

## Data Preprocessing

Load the dataset.
Remove unwanted white spaces from the dataset.
Change column names for consistency.
Check for null values.
Explore data information and summary statistics.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Divide the dataset into numerical and categorical columns.
Calculate and visualize the correlation matrix.
Recommendations Based on Medical Conditions
Define a function to provide recommendations for a given medical condition.
Get user input for a medical condition and display corresponding recommendations.
Ensure proper error handling for invalid inputs.

## Usage

Open Healthcare Database.ipynb in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
Run the cells sequentially to execute the code.
Follow the prompts to input a medical condition and receive recommendations.
